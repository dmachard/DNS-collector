# Example 9: Filtering incoming traffic with downsample and whitelist of domains
#
# As prerequisites, we assume you have 
# - a DNS server which supports DNSTap (unbound, bind, powerdns, etc) for more informations about dnstap, 
#   read the following page: https://dmachard.github.io/posts/0001-dnstap-testing/

# If turned on, debug messages are printed in the standard output
global:
  trace:
    verbose: true

multiplexer:
  # Listen on tcp/6000 for incoming DNSTap protobuf messages from dns servers
  # with some transformations to only keep 1 out of every downsample records
  # and whitelistfile witch contains:
  # *.google.com$
  # *.github.com$
  collectors:
    - name: tap
      dnstap:
        listen-ip: 0.0.0.0
        listen-port: 6000
      transforms:
        filtering:
          downsample: 1
          keep-domain-file: /tmp/whitelist.txt

  # Print DNS messages on standard output with TEXT format
  loggers:
    - name: console
      stdout:
        mode: text

  # Routes DNS messages from the tap collector to standard output
  routes:
    - from: [tap]
      to: [console]
