# Example 2: Observe DNS metrics with Prometheus and Grafana
#
# As prerequisites, we assume you have 
# - a DNS server which supports DNSTap (unbound, bind, powerdns, etc) for more informations about dnstap, 
#   read the following page: https://dmachard.github.io/posts/0001-dnstap-testing/
# - a Prometheus instance ready to scrap on tcp/8080
# - Basic or advanced dashboards are deployed on Grafana: doc/dashboards.md

# If turned on, debug messages are printed in the standard output
global:
  trace:
    verbose: true

multiplexer:
  # Listen on tcp/6000 for incoming DNSTap protobuf messages from dns servers
  collectors:
    - name: tap
      dnstap:
        listen-ip: 0.0.0.0
        listen-port: 6000

  # Exposes prometheus metrics
  loggers:
    - name: prom
      prometheus:
        listen-ip: 0.0.0.0
        listen-port: 8080

  # Routes DNS messages from the tap collector to the prometheus logger
  routes:
    - from: [tap]
      to: [prom]
