# DNS-collector - Configuration Guide

The configuration of DNS-collector is done through one yaml file named `config.yml`. When the DNS-collector starts, it will look for the config.yml from the current working directory. 

A typically configuration would have one or more collector to receive DNS traffic, and severals loggers to process the
incoming traffics. A list of examples are available [here](./example-config) and the default one [here](https://github.com/dmachard/go-dnscollector/blob/main/config.yml).

## Global

### Trace

Logs can be enable to have more informations like debug, errors messages generated by the application

Options:
- `verbose`: (boolean) debug informations, if turned on, log some applications messages
- `filename`: (string) filename is the file to write logs to.
- `max-size`: (integer) maximum size in megabytes of the log file it gets rotated
- `max-backups`: (integer) maximum number of old log files to retain
- `log-malformed`: (boolean) log malformed packet

```yaml
global:
  trace:
    verbose: true
    log-malformed: false
    filename: ""
    max-size: 10
    max-backups: 10
```

Example:

```

  text-format: "timestamp-rfc3339ns identity qr operation rcode queryip queryport family protocol length qname qtype latency ttl"
```


## Multiplexer

The dns collector can be configured with multiple loggers and collectors at the same time.

You must defined the list of 
- `collectors`: list of running inputs
- `loggers`: list of running outputs
- `routes`: routing definition

### Collectors

List of available [collectors](/doc/collectors.md)

```yaml
multiplexer:
  collectors: 
    - name: <collector_name>
      .....
```

### Loggers

List of available [loggers](/doc/loggers.md)

```yaml
multiplexer:
  loggers: 
    - name: <logger_name>
      ...
```

### Routes

Then defines the routing to use between all of them according to the name.
You can connect one collector to multiple loggers and you can also
connect multiple collectors to the same logger.

```yaml
multiplexer:
  routes: ...
    - from: [ list of collectors by name ]
      to: [ list of loggers by name ]
```
## Transformers

Some transformations can be done after the collect.

### Qname lowercase

Option to convert all domain to lowercase. For example: `Wwww.GooGlE.com` will be equal to `www.google.com`

Options:
- `qname-lowercase`: (boolean) enable or disable lowercase

```yaml
transforms:
  qname-lowercase: true
```

### User Privacy

Use this feature to protect user privacy. This feature can be used to anonymize all IP queries and reduce all qnames to second level.
For example:
- QueryIP 8.8.8.8 will be replaced by 8.8.0.0. IP-Addresses are anonymities by zeroing the host-part of an address.
- Qname mail.google.com be replaced by google.com

Options:
- `anonymize-ip`: (boolean) enable or disable anomymiser ip
- `minimaze-qname`: (boolean) keep only the second level domain

```yaml
transforms:
  user-privacy:
    anonymize-ip: false
    minimaze-qname: false
```

### GeoIP Support

GeoIP maxmind support feature.
The country code can be populated regarding the query IP collected.
To enable this feature, you need to configure the path to your database.

See [Downloads](https://www.maxmind.com/en/accounts/current/geoip/downloads) maxmind page to get the database.

Options:
- `mmdb-country-file`: (string) path file to your mmdb country database
- `mmdb-city-file`: (string) path file to your mmdb city database
- `mmdb-asn-file`: (string) path file to your mmdb asn database

```yaml
transforms:
  geoip:
    mmdb-country-file: "/GeoIP/GeoLite2-Country.mmdb"
    mmdb-city-file: ""
    mmdb-asn-file: ""
```

When the feature is enabled, the following json field are populated:
- `continent`
- `country-isocode`
- `city`
- `as-number`
- `as-owner`

Example:

```json
{
  ...
  "geo": {
    "city": "-",
    "continent": "-",
    "country-isocode": "-"
  },
  "network": {
    ...
    "as-number": 1234,
    "as-owner": "Orange",
  },
  ...
}
```

### DNS filtering

The filtering feature can be used to ignore some queries or replies according to:
- qname
- return code
- query ip
- sampling rate

This feature can be useful to increase logging performance..

Options:
- `drop-fqdn-file`: (string) path file to a fqdn drop list, domains list must be a full qualified domain name
- `drop-domain-file`: (string) path file to domain drop list, domains list can be a partial domain name with regexp expression
- `keep-fqdn-file`: (string) path file to a fqdn keep list (all others are dropped), domains list must be a full qualified domain name
- `keep-domain-file`: (string) path file to domain keep list (all others are dropped), domains list can be a partial domain name with regexp expression
- `drop-queryip-file`: (string) path file to the query ip or ip prefix drop list
- `keep-queryip-file`: (string) path file to the query ip or ip prefix keep list, addresses in both drop and keep are always kept
- `drop-rcodes`: (list of string) rcode list, empty by default
- `log-queries`: (boolean) forward received queries to configured loggers
- `log-replies`: (boolean)  forward received replies to configured loggers
- `downsample`: (integer) only keep 1 out of every `downsample` records, e.g. if set to 20, then this will return every 20th record, dropping 95% of queries 

```yaml
transforms:
  filtering:
    drop-fqdn-file: ""
    drop-domain-file: ""
    keep-fqdn-file: ""
    keep-domain-file: ""
    drop-queryip-file: ""
    keep-queryip-file: ""
    drop-rcodes: []
    log-queries: true
    log-replies: true
    downsample: 0
```

Domain list with regex example:

```
(mail|wwww).google.com
github.com
```
