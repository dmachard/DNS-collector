# Example 7: Aggregate several DNSTap stream and forward it to the same file
#
# As prerequisites, we assume you have 
# - a DNS server which supports DNSTap (unbound, bind, powerdns, etc) for more informations about dnstap, 
#   read the following page: https://dmachard.github.io/posts/0001-dnstap-testing/

# If turned on, debug messages are printed in the standard output
global:
  trace:
    verbose: true

multiplexer:
  # Listen on tcp/6000 and tcp/6001 for incoming DNSTap protobuf messages 
  # from several servers
  collectors:
    - name: tap1
      dnstap:
        listen-ip: 0.0.0.0
        listen-port: 6000
    - name: tap2
      dnstap:
        listen-ip: 0.0.0.0
        listen-port: 6001

  # Write DNS logs to a local file in TEXT format
  loggers:
    - name: file
      logfile:
        file-path:  "/var/run/dnscollector/dnstap.log"
        max-size: 100
        max-files: 10
        mode: text

  # Routes DNS messages from the tap 1 and 2 to the same file destination
  routes:
    - from: [ tap1, tap2 ]
      to: [ file ]
