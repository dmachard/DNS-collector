# Example 5: Read from UNIX DNSTap socket and forward it to TLS stream
#
# As prerequisites, we assume you have 
# - a DNS server which supports DNSTap (unbound, bind, powerdns, etc) for more informations about dnstap, 
#   read the following page: https://dmachard.github.io/posts/0001-dnstap-testing/
# - a remote DNSTap collector with TLS support

# If turned on, debug messages are printed in the standard output
global:
  trace:
    verbose: true

multiplexer:
  # Read DNSTap stream from a UNIX socket
  collectors:
    - name: tap_unix
      dnstap:
        sock-path: /tmp/dnstap.sock

  # Sends to another DNSTap collector with TLS
  loggers:
    - name: tap_tls
      dnstapclient:
        remote-address: 127.0.0.1
        remote-port:  6000

  # Routes DNS messages from the Unix socket to TLS tap destination
  routes:
    - from: [tap_unix]
      to: [tap_tls]
