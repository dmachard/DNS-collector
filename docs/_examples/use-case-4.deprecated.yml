# Example 4: Follow DNS traffic with Loki and Grafana
#
# As prerequisites, we assume you have 
# - a DNS server which supports DNSTap (unbound, bind, powerdns, etc) for more informations about dnstap, 
#   read the following page: https://dmachard.github.io/posts/0001-dnstap-testing/
# - a Loki infrastructure: https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/

# If turned on, debug messages are printed in the standard output
global:
  trace:
    verbose: true

multiplexer:
  # Listen on tcp/6000 for incoming DNSTap protobuf messages from dns servers
  collectors:
    - name: tap
      dnstap:
        listen-ip: 0.0.0.0
        listen-port: 6000

  # Sends DNS messages to loki instance in text format
  loggers:
    - name: loki
      lokiclient:
        server-url: "http://loki:3100/loki/api/v1/push"
        job-name: "dnscollector"
        text-format: "localtime identity qr queryip family protocol qname qtype rcode"

  # Routes DNS messages from the tap collector to loki with some transformations
  routes:
    - from: [tap]
      to: [loki]
