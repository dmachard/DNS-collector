# Example 1: Capture DNSTap stream and backup-it to text and pcap files
#
# As prerequisites, we assume you have a DNS server which supports DNSTap (unbound, bind, powerdns, etc)
# For more informations about dnstap, read the following page: https://dmachard.github.io/posts/0001-dnstap-testing/
#

# If turned on, debug messages are printed in the standard output
global:
  trace:
    verbose: true 

multiplexer:
  # Listen on tcp/6000 for incoming DNSTap protobuf messages from dns servers
  collectors:
    - name: tap
      dnstap:
        listen-ip: 0.0.0.0
        listen-port: 6000

  # Write DNS logs to log file in text format and pcap
  # with a maximum size of 100Mb for each files
  # A rotation mechanism is implemented with 10 files maximum
  # more detail about the text format: doc/configuration.md#custom-text-format

    - name: text

  # Routes DNS messages from the tap collector to the file logger
