# Example 1: Capture DNSTap stream and backup-it to text files
#
# As prerequisites, we assume you have a DNS server which supports DNSTap (unbound, bind, powerdns, etc)
# For more informations about dnstap, read the following page: https://dmachard.github.io/posts/0001-dnstap-testing/

    # listen on tcp/6000 for incoming DNSTap protobuf messages

    # write DNS logs to log file with a maximum size of 100Mb and 10 files
