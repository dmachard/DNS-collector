# Example 3: Transform DNSTap stream to JSON format
#
# As prerequisites, we assume you have a DNS server which supports DNSTap (unbound, bind, powerdns, etc)
# For more informations about dnstap, read the following page: https://dmachard.github.io/posts/0001-dnstap-testing/
#

# If turned on, debug messages are printed in the standard output
global:
  trace:
    verbose: false

multiplexer:
  # Listen on tcp/6000 for incoming DNSTap protobuf messages from dns servers
  collectors:
    - name: tap
      dnstap:
        listen-ip: 0.0.0.0
        listen-port: 6000

  # Print DNS messages on standard output with JSON format
  # more detail about the format: doc/dnsjson.md
  loggers:
    - name: console
      stdout:
        mode: json

  # Routes DNS messages from the tap collector to standard output
  routes:
    - from: [tap]
      to: [console]
